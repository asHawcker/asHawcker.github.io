## My contributions

I mainly handled the Image processing part of the entire project wherein I wrote the Image processing functions from scratch in C (except for the canny edge detector).

Here is the list of the functions I implemented:

{{< emgithub target="https://github.com/asHawcker/dsl-for-image-manipulation-in-c/blob/main/runtime.h#L12-L37" lang=c tab_size=8 >}}

All of the function definitions can be found in [_runtime.c_](https://github.com/asHawcker/dsl-for-image-manipulation-in-c/blob/main/runtime.c)

## My learnings

- Through this project I mainly got into the rabbit hole of image processing on a low-level by directly manipulating the values in the matrix.

- Understood how the algorithms really work and why do they work.
- Understood how a compiler actually works and what are the different components or stages that bring a programming language to existence.
